Terraria if you were a manager of the characters.

You start out with a little hut and a randomly generated world.  You have 3 workers.
How will you survive the night?  You can set your workers to collect resources from trees and to dig tunnels in search of valuable stones.
Automate your workers or take complete control of them yourselves.
Once you have the resources, begin upgrading your hut in to a bubbling metropolis.

Watch out!  Bandits have spotted your village and want to take a set of your profits.  Specialize a worker in fighting to repel them.
